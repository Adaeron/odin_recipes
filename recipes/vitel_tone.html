    <h3 class="subTitulo">Sauce</h3>

            <li>Add about ½ cup (150ml) of the strained cooking broth and continue blending. Add the mustard, anchovies, mayonnaise, lemon juice and black pepper. Blend until well mixed. If the sauce is not liquid enough, add more broth.</li>

            <li>Grate the remaining whites of the hard-boiled eggs, and sprinkle around the meat on the edges of the platter.</li>
            <li>Leave the vitel tone a few hours in the refrigerator so the meat can absorb the flavors. Serve cold or at room temperature.</li>
